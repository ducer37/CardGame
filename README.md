This project implement a game that supports two popular Vietnamese card games: Phỏm (Contract Rummy) and Tiến Lên Miền Bắc (Northern Vietnamese Thirteen).

The game provides two visual modes: a simple UI for lightweight performance and rapid prototyping, and a complex UI for a richer, more engaging user experience. Players can choose to compete against each other in multiplayer mode or play against AI-controlled bots. The bots are implemented with straightforward decision-making logic, enabling reliable yet predictable gameplay suitable for testing and casual play.

The backend architecture follows solid Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring that the codebase is clean, modular, and easy to maintain. 

Overall, the project aims to deliver a configurable, expandable, and well-structured foundation for Vietnamese card game development
